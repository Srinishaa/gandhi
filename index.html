        <p>Most of the people who came to see Gandhi sought his advice on something or the other. But one day came a party of visitors from China. "Gandhiji, we have brought you a small gift," they said. "It is no bigger than a child's toy, but it is famous in our country." To Gandhi's delight it was a set of the three monkeys that were later to become so well-known and was kept carefully by him for the rest of his life.</p>

              <div class="para2"><h2>My Master's Master</h2><p>
                  Gandhiji inspired many, but who inspired him? Here's a story that gives hint towards this.<br>
                  
                  This story has to do with Dr. Kumarappa, who had decided to live in a hut in Kallupatti in Madurai District of Tamil Nadu. It was a hut he had built himself. On the inner walls of his hut hung a photograph that would attract anyone's attention. It was a picture that showed a common farmer, with a turban on his head. What was this photograph doing here, in the house of a man such as Dr. Kumarappa? Many an important visitor would ask Dr. Kumarappa about this mysteriously unimportant looking man.<br>
                  
                  "Oh, he's my master's master." Dr. Kumarappa would say. "Master's master?"<br>
                  
                  "You see," Dr. Kumarappa would explain to the puzzled visitor, "my master is Gandhiji, and this villager, indeed every poor person in the land, is his master." </p>
